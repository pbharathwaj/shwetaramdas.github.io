### Mental Health
* For students: I have struggled with my mental health since graduate school. Trawling through people's professional websites can be anxiety-inducing. This is to say: You are enough. Reach out for the help you need.  Shoot me an email if you ever want to discuss mental health. I will do my best to respond.
