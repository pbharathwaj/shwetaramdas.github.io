### Research Interests
I am a highly collaborative researcher and am primarily interested in 

* Genetic architecture of gene regulation in human populations
* Rare regulatory variation in identified in bottlenecked human populations
* Identifying the regulatory architecture of complex traits (specifically lipid levels)
* Building tools for genomics

In the past, I have worked on projects tying genetic variation to complex phenotypes. I catalogued systematic errors in the rat genome sequence assembly, developed a visualization tool for rare variant burden analyses, and .


### Research Projects

#### Global Lipid Genetics Consortium
I am a lead analyst in the Global Lipids Genetic Consortium, working on interpreting GWAS signals to identify causal genes in lipid biology, and study the genetic architecture of complex traits in human populations. My work was selected for a Reviewer's choice award at ASHG2020.

#### Identifying cis-regulatory variation in the Amish population
I'm interested in using founder populations to characterize high-impact regulatory variation in the human genome.
