### Research Interests
I am a highly collaborative researcher and am primarily interested in 

* Genetic architecture of gene regulation in human populations
* Rare regulatory variation in identified in bottlenecked human populations
* Identifying the regulatory architecture of complex traits (specifically lipid levels)
* Building tools for genomics

In the past, I have worked on projects tying genetic variation to complex phenotypes. I catalogued systematic errors in the rat genome sequence assembly, developed a visualization tool for rare variant burden analyses, and .


### Research Projects

#### Global Lipid Genetics Consortium
The tool will also be capable of executing application traces across multiple Android versions. (<a href="/pubs/date2018.pdf">DATE 2018</a>, <a href="/pubs/mobicom2018.pdf">MobiCom 2018</a>)

#### Identifying cis-regulatory variation in the Amish population
